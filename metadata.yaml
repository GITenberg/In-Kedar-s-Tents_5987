description: To help his friend, Geoffrey Horner, a gentleman radical who has become
  embroiled with the Chartists, evade murder charges in England, his barrister, Frederick
  Conyngham, attracts suspicion on himself and leaves for Spain, where he becomes
  an officer on the Royalist side in the Carlist War. Conyngham becomes immersed in
  intrigue when what he thinks is a love letter he has agreed to deliver, turns out
  to be a Carlist manifesto. His adventures take him to Ronda, Cuidad Real, Madrid,
  Toledo, and beyond.
